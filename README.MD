# My 2024 QubitXQubit final project

The original goal of this project was to create a simple bb84 protocol with the inclusion of an eavesdropper's measurement attack. $bare_bb84.ipynb$ was the first code that I wrote, and it's just a carbon copy of the bb84 protocol that I did in a lab notebook. $Eve_attack_bb84.ipynb$ added a measurement attack to the protocol. It was at this point that I decided to bring in matplotlib and do some statistical analysis on the security of bb84. 

But, the project became really cool and I started begin exploring other things such as noisy simulations! I'm still in the middle of that, and I'll post some results soon!
